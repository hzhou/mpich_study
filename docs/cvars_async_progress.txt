        If set to true, MPICH will initiate an additional thread to
        make asynchronous progress on all communication operations
        including point-to-point, collective, one-sided operations and
        I/O.  Setting this variable will automatically increase the
        thread-safety level to MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE.  While this
        improves the progress semantics, it might cause a small amount
        of performance overhead for regular MPI operations.  The user
        is encouraged to leave one or more hardware threads vacant in
        order to prevent contention between the application threads
        and the progress thread(s).  The impact of oversubscription is
        highly system dependent but may be substantial in some cases,
        hence this recommendation.
