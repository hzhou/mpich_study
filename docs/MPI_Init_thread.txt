/*@
   MPI_Init_thread - Initialize the MPI execution environment

Input Parameters:
+  argc - Pointer to the number of arguments
.  argv - Pointer to the argument vector
-  required - Level of desired thread support

Output Parameters:
.  provided - Level of provided thread support

   Command line arguments:
   MPI specifies no command-line arguments but does allow an MPI
   implementation to make use of them.  See 'MPI_INIT' for a description of
   the command line arguments supported by 'MPI_INIT' and 'MPI_INIT_THREAD'.

   Notes:
   The valid values for the level of thread support are\:
+ MPI_THREAD_SINGLE - Only one thread will execute.
. MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED - The process may be multi-threaded, but only the main
  thread will make MPI calls (all MPI calls are funneled to the
   main thread).
. MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED - The process may be multi-threaded, and multiple
  threads may make MPI calls, but only one at a time: MPI calls are not
  made concurrently from two distinct threads (all MPI calls are serialized).
- MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE - Multiple threads may call MPI, with no restrictions.

Notes for Fortran:
   Note that the Fortran binding for this routine does not have the 'argc' and
   'argv' arguments. ('MPI_INIT_THREAD(required, provided, ierror)')
