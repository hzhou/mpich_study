configure.ac: device directory parsing
    device_name=`echo $device_name ~ sed -e 's%.*/%%'`
    should be ...`echo $device_name | sed ...`

configure.ac: unify subsystem check for device, pm, pmi

configure.ac: with_cross=$MPID_DEFAULT_CROSS_FILE -- where is MPID_... set?

configure.ac: config_namepublisher: FIXME

aclocal_cc.m4: AM_PROG_CC_C_0: silent-rules supported automatically now

configure.ac: enable_fortran: FIXME, need clearer logic

configure.ac: need account for all exports

mpid/ch4/subconfigure.m4: ver 3.3b3 missing: MPICH_SUBCFG_BEFORE=src/mpid/common/bc

aclocal.m4: how did [src/hwloc/config/hwloc*.m4] get included by aclocal? Should be in configure.ac where they are being used.

configure.ac: AC_CANONICAL_TARGET despite the comment "TARGET not needed, MPICH isn't a compiler"
aclocal_check_visibility.m4: case ${target} in -- should be ${host}
pm/hydra/configure.ac: AC_CANONICAL_TARGET (for the same reason)

build: mpl are configure and built three times under mpl, pm/hydra/mpl, mpi/romio/mpl
       hwloc are configure and built twice under hwloc and pm/hydra/tools/topo/hwloc/hwloc/configure
       solution: in sub configure.ac try detect mpl in the parent dir first
